The application allows users to input text in one language (source) and translate it to another (destination).
Users can select both the source and destination languages from a list of supported languages.
It supports multiple languages such as English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, and more, thanks to services like Google Translate API or pre-trained AI models.
Streamlit provides an intuitive and simple interface for building the app with minimal code.
The interface typically includes:
A text input field for users to type their text.
Dropdown menus to select source and destination languages.
A button to trigger translation.
A text output area to display the translated result.
The system can provide real-time translation as the user enters text, or upon clicking a button to trigger the translation process.
The translation engine uses AI and machine learning models to ensure accurate and context-aware translations.
The app uses AI models or APIs like Google Translate API or other neural machine translation (NMT) models (e.g., MarianMT or OpenNMT) to perform translations.
The text-to-speech (TTS) engine converts the translated text to speech using libraries like pyttsx3 or gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech).
Streamlit is used to create an interactive web interface with components like input fields, buttons, dropdowns, and output areas.
It also supports displaying the translation result dynamically, enabling users to interact with the app easily.
